 The Coder's Computer

Introduction, The Command Line:

Linux has a graphical user interface and it works pretty much like the GUI's on other systems that you are familiar with such as Windows and OSX. This tutorial won't focus on these as I reckon you can probably figure that part out by yourself. This tutorial will focus instead on the command line (also known as a terminal) running Bash.

The command line is an interesting beast, and if you've not used one before, can be a bit daunting. Don't worry, with a bit of practice you'll soon come to see it as your friend. Don't think of it as leaving the GUI behind so much as adding to it. While you can leave the GUI alltogether, most people open up a command line interface just as another window on their desktop (in fact you can have as many open as you like). This is also to our advantage as we can have several command lines open and doing different tasks in each at the same time. We can also easily jump back to the GUI when it suits us. Experiment until you find the setup that suits you best. As an example I will typically have 3 terminals open: 1 in which I do my working, another to bring up ancilliary data and  a final one for viewing Manual pages (more on these later).




Basic Navigation

Introduction

In this section, we'll learn the basics of moving around the system. Many tasks rely on being able to get to, or reference the correct location in the system. As such, this stuff really forms the foundation of being able to work effectively in Linux. Make sure you understand it well.

PWd Stand for print working ,  It tells you what your current or present working directory is. Give it a try now.

Ls -a to show hidden files.

cd moves into whichever directory is specified by the first command line argument only. 

omparison of “basic” text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE:

The term “IDE” comes from Integrated Development Environment. It is intended as a set of tools that all work together: text editor,
compiler, build or make integration, debugging, etc. Virtually all IDEs are tied specifically to a language or framework or tightly
collected set of languages or frameworks. Some examples: Visual Studio for .NET and other Microsoft languages, RubyMine for Ruby, 
IntelliJ for Java, XCode for Apple technologies.

A text editor just display plain text in one color (black on white, usually, often with monospaced font), with more or less advanced 
facilities (search, replace, perhaps with regexes, macros / automation, etc.). A good text editor might be optimized to handle 
very large files, etc.
